# Claude Instructions

## Markdown Formatting

**NEVER use emojis in markdown content.** This is a strict requirement that must be followed at all times. Do not add emojis to any markdown files, documentation, README files, or any other text content unless explicitly requested by the user. Keep all markdown clean and professional without decorative emojis.
